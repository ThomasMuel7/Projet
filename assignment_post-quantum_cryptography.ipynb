    "The General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) is the most efficient classical algorithm known for factoring large integers larger than $10^{100}$. Its history traces the evolution of computational number theory and reflects decades of research aimed at understanding the limits of public-key cryptography, particularly RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origins of the method go back to the 1980s, when John Pollard introduced the Number Field Sieve for a very special class of integers known as Cunningham numbers. Building on this idea, Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik Lenstra, Mark Manasse, and John Pollard generalized the approach in the early 1990s, creating the algorithm now known as the GNFS. This breakthrough provided, for the first time, a sub-exponential algorithm that could factor arbitrary large integers more efficiently than the Quadratic Sieve, which had been the previous state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that point forward, GNFS became the central tool in record-setting factorizations. In 1994, it was used to factor RSA-129, a 129-digit number (426 bits) made famous by Martin Gardner’s challenge in Scientific American. Over the following decades, GNFS was refined and scaled up through distributed computing efforts and advances in algorithm engineering. Notable milestones include the factorization of RSA-768 (232 digits) in 2009, RSA-240 (795 bits) in 2019, and RSA-250 in 2020. Each of these achievements pushed the limits of available hardware and demonstrated both the power of GNFS and the ongoing need to increase RSA key sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, GNFS remains the gold standard for classical integer factorization. Its history underscores the constant interplay between mathematical innovation and computational progress, and it provides the foundation for our understanding of how secure RSA remains in the face of classical attacks."

    "\n",
    "**Core idea of GNFS:** Reduce factoring $n$ to finding a congruence of squares modulo $n$:\n",
    "$s^2 \\equiv r^2 \\pmod{n} \\Rightarrow$ potential factorization via gcd.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Choose $m$ and $f(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by picking an integer $m$ close to $n^{1/d}$, where $d$ is the degree of the polynomial we want to construct. Using the base-$m$ expansion of $n$:\n",
    "$$n = a_d m^d + a_{d-1} m^{d-1} + \\dots + a_0$$we define the polynomial$$f(x) = a_d x^d + a_{d-1} x^{d-1} + \\dots + a_0$$\n",
    "so that $f(m) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$. This polynomial encodes $n$ in a way that allows us to later find algebraic numbers whose squares are congruent modulo $n$, which is key to factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** The base-$m$ expansion provides an easy way to construct a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients where $f(m)=n$. This ensures the crucial congruence $f(m) \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ holds, which is a fundamental requirement for the mapping $\\phi$ used later in the algorithm. For example, to factor $n=45113$, we can choose $m=31$ and use its base-31 expansion: $45113 = 1 \\cdot 31^3 + 15 \\cdot 31^2 + 29 \\cdot 31 + 8$. From this, we can define the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 29x + 8$."

An integer $l$ is considered \"smooth\" over $R$ if all of its prime divisors are in $R$. This is a core concept that allows us to convert the factorization problem into a linear algebra problem over $\\mathbb{F}_2$."

    "In the first step, we built a list of small prime numbers to act as our \"factoring toolkit\" for regular integers. In this step, we're doing the same thing, but for a new, abstract number system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we're not just working with numbers anymore, but with a new kind of \"number plant\" that has sprouted from our polynomial. These \"number plants\" are called **algebraic numbers**, and they look like $a + b\\theta$. This is similar to how complex numbers are built: we introduce a symbol $i$ with $i^2 = -1$, and then form numbers of the type $a + bi$. So what is $\\theta$ in our case? It’s a special symbol we introduce to represent a root of our polynomial $f(x)$. For example, if $f(x) = x^2 - 2$, then $\\theta = \\sqrt{2}$ because $\\theta^2 = 2$. We don’t need to know $\\theta$ as a decimal; we just work with it symbolically, like we do with i. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now need a way to factor these new \"plants\" so we create an **algebraic factor base**, which is our toolkit of special \"algebraic prime seeds\" for this new number system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We identify these \"prime seeds\" as pairs of regular numbers, $(r_i, p_i)$, that satisfy a specific condition: when you plug $r_i$ into our original polynomial, the result is divisible by the prime $p_i$ (i.e., $f(r_i) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p_i}$). This clever trick lets us use something we know (our polynomial) to find and categorize these new \"algebraic primes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** The goal is to find \"number plants\" ($a + b\\theta$) that can be completely factored using only the \"prime seeds\" in our toolkit. We call these numbers \"smooth,\" just as we did with the regular integers. This ensures that the algebraic side of our calculations is manageable and mirrors the integer side, providing two parallel sets of data that will eventually be combined. For example, with $n=45113$, we found our \"prime seeds\" by looking at all primes less than 90 : \n",

    "Finally, we map the algebraic product back to integers using\n",
    "$$x^2 = \\phi \\left( \\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_j\\theta) \\right),$$$$y^2 = \\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + bm)$$and try to extract factors via$$\\gcd(n, x+y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\gcd(n, x-y)$$\n",
    "If a nontrivial factor is found, the algorithm succeeds. Otherwise, we repeat the process with a new factor base or additional smooth pairs. This step exploits the classical “difference of squares” idea: if $s^2 \\equiv r^2 \\pmod{n}$, then $\\gcd(s \\pm r, n)$ often reveals a nontrivial factor of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** With the subset of pairs $V$ from the previous step, we compute the products to get a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$. We then compute the integer value of the algebraic perfect square using the mapping $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. This mapping satisfies $\\phi(\\theta) \\equiv m \\pmod n$. Thus, if $\\beta^2 = \\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_j\\theta)$, then $\\phi(\\beta^2) = \\phi(\\beta)\\phi(\\beta)$ and $\\phi(\\beta^2) = \\phi(\\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_j\\theta)) = \\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_jm)$. This creates the congruence of squares $x^2 \\equiv y^2 \\pmod n$ that can be used for factorization with a high probability of success. For example, in the case of $n=45113$, this process led to the discovery of factors 197 and 229."

Together, these discoveries formed the foundation of quantum theory, revolutionizing our understanding of the natural world.\n",

    "Superposition is one of the most fundamental ideas in quantum mechanics. Unlike a classical bit, which can only be in a definite state of `0` or `1`, a quantum bit (qubit) can exist in a combination of both states at the same time, with certain probabilities. But we will talk about qubits later. Erwin Schrödinger illustrated this with his famous thought experiment known as Schrödinger’s cat. Imagine a cat placed in a sealed box with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, and a vial of poison that will be released if the atom decays. According to quantum theory, before the box is opened, the atom is in a superposition of “decayed” and “not decayed.” Consequently, the cat is also in a superposition of being both alive and dead simultaneously. It is only when we observe (open the box) that the system collapses into one definite outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "This \"collapse\" happens in the quantum world whenever we observe or measure a particle: the superposition disappears and we only see one definite result. Because of this, it is also impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state. This is called the no-cloning theorem. In everyday life, we can copy files on a computer or duplicate a piece of paper. But with quantum particles, copying would mean knowing the exact state of the particle without disturbing it — and that is impossible. If we try to measure the particle to figure out its state, the superposition collapses, and we lose the original information. In simple terms: you can’t peek at a quantum state without changing it, and you can’t duplicate superposition without destroying it."

In fact, the information is spread faster than the speed of light — it happens instantly. \n",

    "A quantum computer is a new kind of computer that uses the rules of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits that can be in a superposition of 0 and 1 at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one common misconception is that quantum computers can test all possibilities at once to solve any problem instantly. In reality, quantum computers cannot do everything — they are not general-purpose machines like your laptop or phone. For example, you cannot play video games or browse the web on a quantum processor. Instead, quantum computers are specialized tools designed to solve very specific types of problems, such as factoring large numbers, simulating molecules, or optimizing complex systems, where the principles of superposition and entanglement give them an advantage over classical machines."

    "In the quantum world, qubits are delicate and easily disturbed by their environment. Two important timescales describe how long a qubit can maintain its quantum behavior. **Relaxation time (T1)** measures how long a qubit stays in an excited state before it “relaxes” back to its ground state. For example, if a qubit is in state $|1⟩$, T1 tells us how long it takes, on average, to decay to state $|0⟩$. This is sometimes called the energy relaxation time. **Decoherence time (T2)** measures how long a qubit can maintain its quantum superposition (a combination of $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$) before it loses coherence due to interaction with the environment. Decoherence causes the qubit to behave more like a classical bit, destroying the advantages of quantum computation. \n",
    "Let's take the example below. The relaxation time will actually represent the time where the electron spin goes from up to down (qubit 1 to qubit 0) and the decoherence time is the time that the qubit takes to go from a superposition state (right image) to the state 0 (left image) or 1 (middle image)\n",
    "T2 is usually shorter than T1, because decoherence can happen even if the qubit hasn’t lost energy. In simple terms, T1 is how long the qubit keeps its energy, and T2 is how long the qubit keeps its quantum “weirdness” (superposition). These times are critical in designing quantum algorithms because qubits must maintain coherence long enough to perform calculations accurately. "

    "In quantum computing, implementing an algorithm involves **building a quantum circuit**, which is a sequence of operations applied to qubits. These operations are performed using **quantum gates**, which manipulate 1 or many qubits by changing their states, creating superpositions, or generating entanglement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, each quantum gate is represented as a **unitary matrix**. A **unitary matrix** is a special kind of square matrix $U$ that satisfies $U^\\dagger U = U U^\\dagger = I$, where $U^\\dagger$ is the conjugate transpose of $U$ and $I$ is the identity matrix. Unitary matrices preserve the length of vectors, which in quantum computing means they maintain the total probability of a qubit state. All **quantum gates** are represented by unitary matrices because they perform reversible operations on qubits without losing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying a gate to a qubit corresponds to a **matrix multiplication** with the qubit’s state vector. From a computer science perspective, quantum gates provide a **level of abstraction**, allowing us to design and reason about algorithms without worrying about the specific physical hardware. This is similar to classical programming, where we focus on **what the computation does** rather than the details of the underlying processor architecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most famous and useful quantum gates is the **Hadamard gate (H)**, which creates **superposition**. When applied to a qubit, it transforms the basis states $|0⟩$ or $|1⟩$ into an equal superposition of both.  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Select a Base Point $G$**  \n",

    "3. **Key Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Private Key**: The private key is a randomly chosen integer $d$ such that $1 \\leq d \\leq n-1$, where $n$ is the **order of the base point** $G$. The order $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $n \\cdot G = \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the **point at infinity**, acting as the “zero” of the elliptic curve group. You can think of the elliptic curve like a **circular track**: starting at $G$, if you keep running $d$ laps (adding $G$ repeatedly), you eventually return to the starting line after $n$ laps. The private key $d$ is like the **number of laps you choose to run**. Even if someone sees your final position $Q$ on the track, figuring out exactly how many laps you ran (the value of $d$) is extremely hard — this is what keeps ECC secure.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - **Public Key**: The public key is a point $Q$ on the curve, computed as $$ Q = d \\cdot G $$ using **scalar multiplication**, which is repeated addition of the point $G$ to itself $d$ times. For example, $2 \\cdot G = G + G$, $3 \\cdot G = G + G + G$, and so on. This is the core operation: repeatedly adding a point to itself efficiently using double-and-add. Scalar multiplication is computationally easy in the forward direction, but given $Q$ and $G$, it is extremely hard to determine $d$ — this is the **elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)**. This asymmetry is what makes ECC secure: the private key $d$ allows you to generate the public key $Q$, but deriving $d$ from $Q$ without knowing it is computationally infeasible.\n"
