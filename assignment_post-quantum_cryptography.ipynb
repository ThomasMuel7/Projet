    "The General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) is the most efficient classical algorithm known for factoring large integers larger than $10^{100}$. Its history traces the evolution of computational number theory and reflects decades of research aimed at understanding the limits of public-key cryptography, particularly RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origins of the method go back to the 1980s, when John Pollard introduced the Number Field Sieve for a very special class of integers known as Cunningham numbers. Building on this idea, Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik Lenstra, Mark Manasse, and John Pollard generalized the approach in the early 1990s, creating the algorithm now known as the GNFS. This breakthrough provided, for the first time, a sub-exponential algorithm that could factor arbitrary large integers more efficiently than the Quadratic Sieve, which had been the previous state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "From that point forward, GNFS became the central tool in record-setting factorizations. In 1994, it was used to factor RSA-129, a 129-digit number (426 bits) made famous by Martin Gardner’s challenge in Scientific American. Over the following decades, GNFS was refined and scaled up through distributed computing efforts and advances in algorithm engineering. Notable milestones include the factorization of RSA-768 (232 digits) in 2009, RSA-240 (795 bits) in 2019, and RSA-250 in 2020. Each of these achievements pushed the limits of available hardware and demonstrated both the power of GNFS and the ongoing need to increase RSA key sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, GNFS remains the gold standard for classical integer factorization. Its history underscores the constant interplay between mathematical innovation and computational progress, and it provides the foundation for our understanding of how secure RSA remains in the face of classical attacks."

    "##### Step 0: Preliminary Idea – Difference of Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principle:** If we can find integers $s$ and $r$ such that:\n",
    "$s^2 \\equiv r^2 \\pmod{n}$\n",
    "then:\n",
    "$n$ divides $(s - r)(s + r)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factor extraction:** Let $n = p \\cdot q$ (product of two primes). Then at least one of the following is a nontrivial factor of $n$ with high probability ($\\sim 2/3$):\n",
    "$\\gcd(s + r, n)$ or $\\gcd(s - r, n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "*gcd meaning the greatest common divisor*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core idea of GNFS:** Reduce factoring $n$ to finding a congruence of squares modulo $n$:\n",
    "$s^2 \\equiv r^2 \\pmod{n} \\Rightarrow$ potential factorization via gcd.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Choose $m$ and $f(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by picking an integer $m$ close to $n^{1/d}$, where $d$ is the degree of the polynomial we want to construct. Using the base-$m$ expansion of $n$:\n",
    "$$n = a_d m^d + a_{d-1} m^{d-1} + \\dots + a_0$$we define the polynomial$$f(x) = a_d x^d + a_{d-1} x^{d-1} + \\dots + a_0$$\n",
    "so that $f(m) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$. This polynomial encodes $n$ in a way that allows us to later find algebraic numbers whose squares are congruent modulo $n$, which is key to factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** The base-$m$ expansion provides an easy way to construct a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients where $f(m)=n$. This ensures the crucial congruence $f(m) \\equiv 0 \\pmod n$ holds, which is a fundamental requirement for the mapping $\\phi$ used later in the algorithm. For example, to factor $n=45113$, we can choose $m=31$ and use its base-31 expansion: $45113 = 1 \\cdot 31^3 + 15 \\cdot 31^2 + 29 \\cdot 31 + 8$. From this, we can define the polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 29x + 8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Define the rational factor base $R$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we select a finite set of small prime numbers $R = \\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k\\}$. This **rational factor base** will be used to check if certain integers are “smooth,” meaning they factor completely over these primes. Working with smooth numbers ensures that we can later represent them as vectors for linear algebra over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is a mathematical term that refers to the finite field with two elements. In simpler terms, it's a number system that only contains the numbers 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** The rational factor base is a collection of prime numbers. For practical purposes, it is often a set of small, consecutive primes up to a certain bound $M$, such as $R = \\{p: \\text{p is prime and } p \\le M\\}$. For the example of factoring $n=45113$, the rational factor base was chosen as all primes less than 30: $R = \\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}$. An integer $l$ is considered \"smooth\" over $R$ if all of its prime divisors are in $R$. This is a core concept that allows us to convert the factorization problem into a linear algebra problem over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Define the algebraic factor base $A$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we built a list of small prime numbers to act as our \"factoring toolkit\" for regular integers. In this step, we're doing the same thing, but for a new, abstract number system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we're not just working with numbers anymore, but with a new kind of \"number plant\" that has sprouted from our polynomial. These \"number plants\" are called **algebraic numbers**, and they look like $a + b\\theta$. We need a way to factor these new \"plants,\" so we create an **algebraic factor base**, which is our toolkit of special \"algebraic prime seeds\" for this new number system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We identify these \"prime seeds\" as pairs of regular numbers, $(r_i, p_i)$, that satisfy a specific condition: when you plug $r_i$ into our original polynomial, the result is divisible by the prime $p_i$ (i.e., $f(r_i) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p_i}$). This clever trick lets us use something we know (our polynomial) to find and categorize these new \"algebraic primes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** The goal is to find \"number plants\" ($a + b\\theta$) that can be completely factored using only the \"prime seeds\" in our toolkit. We call these numbers \"smooth,\" just as we did with the regular integers. This ensures that the algebraic side of our calculations is manageable and mirrors the integer side, providing two parallel sets of data that will eventually be combined. For example, with $n=45113$, we found our \"prime seeds\" by looking at all primes less than 90 : \n",
    "$A = \\{ (0, 2), (6, 7), (13, 17), (11, 23), ... , (50, 73), (23, 79), (47, 79), (73, 79), (28, 89), (62, 89), (73, 89) \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4: Define the quadratic character base $Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture additional congruence information, we choose a set of primes $Q$ not in $A$ and find integers $s$ such that $f(s) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{q}$. This **quadratic character base** helps control certain signs and parity conditions when combining smooth numbers, which is crucial for guaranteeing that the final products will form perfect squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** This base helps verify that an element in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$ is a perfect square. Each entry in $Q$ is a pair $(s, q)$, where $q$ is a prime not in $A$ and $s$ satisfies $f(s) \\equiv 0 \\pmod q$. These pairs are used to compute the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a+bs}{q}\\right)$, which acts as a check for squareness. The number of entries in $Q$ can be increased to raise the probability that the final result is a perfect square. For $n=45113$, primes 97, 101, 103, and 107 were used to build $Q$. $Q = \\{(28, 97), (87, 101), (47, 103), (4, 107), (8, 107), (80, 107)\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 5: Find smooth pairs $(a, b)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then search for integer pairs $(a, b)$ such that both $a + bm$ and $a + b\\theta$ are smooth over the rational and algebraic factor bases, respectively. By looping over $a$ for fixed $b$ and checking factorability, we collect enough pairs (typically more than $1 + k + l + u$) to ensure the linear system in the next step will have nontrivial solutions. These **smooth pairs** form the building blocks for constructing a congruence of squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1+k+l+u represents the total number of columns in the matrix we are building, where 1 is for the sign bit, k is the number of primes in the rational factor base, l is the number of \"algebraic primes\" in the algebraic factor base, and u is the number of primes in the quadratic character base.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** This is the core \"sieving\" part of the algorithm. We fix a small integer $b$ and let $a$ vary over a range, for example from $-N$ to $N$. For each pair $(a, b)$, we test if $a+bm$ is smooth over the rational factor base $R$ and if $a+b\\theta$ is smooth over the algebraic factor base $A$. This is done using sieve arrays. An integer $q \\in R$ divides $a+bm$ if $a \\equiv -bm \\pmod q$, while an algebraic factor $(r_i, p_i) \\in A$ divides $a+b\\theta$ if $a \\equiv -br_i \\pmod{p_i}$. We continue this process with different values of $b$ until we have found a sufficient number of smooth pairs, which is typically more than the total number of elements in all three bases ($1+k+l+u$).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 6: Construct the matrix $X$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each smooth pair $(a, b)$ is represented as a row vector containing the sign of $a + bm$, the exponents of its rational prime factors modulo 2, the exponents of the algebraic factors modulo 2, and any relevant quadratic characters. Stacking these vectors forms a $y \\times (1+k+l+u)$ matrix $X$. This matrix encodes all information necessary to combine smooth numbers into perfect squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** For each smooth pair $(a,b)$, a row vector is created. The first entry is a sign bit (0 for positive $a+bm$, 1 for negative). The next $k$ entries are the exponents of the primes in the rational factor base $R$ from the factorization of $a+bm$, taken modulo 2. The following $l$ entries are the exponents of the algebraic factors from the factorization of $a+b\\theta$, also modulo 2. Finally, the last $u$ entries are derived from the quadratic character base $Q$, representing whether the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{a+bs}{q}\\right)$ is 1 (entry 0) or -1 (entry 1). This vector essentially summarizes the parity of the exponents and the quadratic characters, which is a concise way to check for perfect squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 7: Solve the linear system modulo 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We solve the system\n",
    "$$X^T \\cdot \\mathbf{A} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$$to find subsets of smooth pairs that, when multiplied together, produce a perfect square both in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$. Let $V \\subset U$ denote the selected subset. By construction:\n",
    "$$\\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + bm) \\text{ is a perfect square in } \\mathbb{Z},$$\n",
    "$$\\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_j\\theta) \\text{ is a perfect square in } \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$$\n",
    "This gives us the congruence of squares needed to attempt factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** The matrix equation $X^T \\mathbf{A} \\equiv \\mathbf{0} \\pmod 2$ is a system of linear equations over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The entries of the vector $\\mathbf{A}$ are either 0 or 1, and a non-trivial solution is guaranteed to exist if the number of rows is greater than the number of columns ($y > 1+k+l+u$). Each $A_j=1$ in the solution vector corresponds to including the $j$-th smooth pair $(a_j, b_j)$ in the product. When the vectors corresponding to these pairs are added modulo 2, the result is the zero vector, which means that all exponents (and signs) in the final product are even, a necessary condition for being a perfect square.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 8: Factor $n$ using the difference of squares\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we map the algebraic product back to integers using\n",
    "$$x^2 = \\phi \\left( \\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_j\\theta) \\right),$$$$y^2 = \\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + bm)$$and try to extract factors via$$\\gcd(n, x+y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\gcd(n, x-y)$$\n",
    "If a nontrivial factor is found, the algorithm succeeds. Otherwise, we repeat the process with a new factor base or additional smooth pairs. This step exploits the classical “difference of squares” idea: if $s^2 \\equiv r^2 \\pmod{n}$, then $\\gcd(s \\pm r, n)$ often reveals a nontrivial factor of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation detail:** With the subset of pairs $V$ from the previous step, we compute the products to get a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\theta]$. We then compute the integer value of the algebraic perfect square using the mapping $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}[\\theta] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$. This mapping satisfies $\\phi(\\theta) \\equiv m \\pmod n$. Thus, if $\\beta^2 = \\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_j\\theta)$, then $\\phi(\\beta^2) = \\phi(\\beta)\\phi(\\beta)$ and $\\phi(\\beta^2) = \\phi(\\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_j\\theta)) = \\prod_{(a_j, b_j) \\in V} (a_j + b_jm)$. This creates the congruence of squares $x^2 \\equiv y^2 \\pmod n$ that can be used for factorization with a high probability of success. For example, in the case of $n=45113$, this process led to the discovery of factors 197 and 229."
